									<p>The need for effective risk management has rarely been so urgent. As Boards of Directors, CEOs, and
										CFOs grapple with the implications of COVID-19 including employee engagement, customer communication,
										supply chain issues and financial implications the truth remains: <strong>threats to the business can come
										from any direction.</strong> These include not only pandemics, terrorist acts or financial disaster, but strategic
										risks such as the emergence of market disruptors or a failure to predict marketplace shifts. Unfortunately,
										with our focus on COVID-19 issues, we have become more vulnerable to other risks.</p>

									<span>
										<strong>While companies are busy responding to COVID-19 issues, it is also a good time to assess the current risk
										management process to determine if it is poised to manage business risks in the future. Here are some
										questions to consider:
										</strong>
										<ul>
											<li><i>How well were we prepared to respond to COVID-19?</i></li>
											<li><i>Did our business continuity plan support our operations effectively?</i></li>
											<li><i>Have we evaluated our risk appetite considering the current business climate?</i></li>
											<li><i>Is our risk management infrastructure and governance optimized for the future?</i></li>
											<li><i>Has our ERM process identified our real risks? What about emerging exposures?</i></li>
											<li><i>Is our risk management process aligned with our business objectives?</i></li>
											<li><i>Are we leveraging our risk business partners properly (brokers, TPAâ€™s, etc.)?</i></li>
											<li><i>Is risk managed in silos or is the approach an integrated one?</i></li>
											<li><i>Does the strategic planning process include a formal risk evaluation component?</i></li>
										</ul>
									</span>
									

									<p>
										While we need to focus on the implications of COVID-19 it is not too early to step back and consider a
										review of how we manage risk today. Did our risk management and business continuity functions respond
										to and handle the COVID-19 crisis effectively?
